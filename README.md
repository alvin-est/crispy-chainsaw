# Customizable Text-to-Speech App

## Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to upload files and enter text for conversion into speech. The app uses APIs from text-to-speech services to generate audio files based on user input.

## Features

- Upload files (e.g., text files, PDFs) or enter text
- Select conversion options (e.g., voice, language, speed)
- Generate audio files
- Save favorite text-to-speech conversions
- Share audio files with others

## Technical Stack

- Front-end: React or Angular
- CSS framework: Materialize or Semantic UI
- Server-side APIs: Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, or Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services
- Client-side storage: Local storage or cookies
- Modal: Used for displaying conversion options

## Future Development

- Voice cloning
- Custom voices
- Integration with other applications
- Social media integration

## Deployment

- Deployed to GitHub Pages
- Responsive and polished UI

## Technical Acceptance Criteria

- **Server-side APIs:** The app could use APIs from text-to-speech services like Google Cloud Text-to-Speech, Amazon Polly, or Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services to convert text to speech.
- **Client-side storage:** The app could store user preferences, uploaded files, and favorite text-to-speech conversions using local storage or cookies.
- **Modal:** The app could use a modal to display text-to-speech conversion options, such as voice, language, and speed.
- **CSS framework:** The app could use a CSS framework like Materialize or Semantic UI instead of Bootstrap.
- **Interactive:** The app would accept and respond to user input, such as uploading files, entering text, and selecting conversion options.

## Concept

- The app would solve the real-world problem of allowing users to convert text to speech in a customizable and user-friendly way, making it easier for them to create audio content.
- The motivation for development would be to provide a personalized and accessible way for people to convert text to speech.

## Process

- The app could be developed using a JavaScript framework like React or Angular, and the team could use tools like Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
- Tasks and roles could be assigned based on team members' strengths and interests, with some members focusing on front-end development, others on back-end development, and others on design and user experience.
- Challenges could include integrating multiple APIs, managing file uploads and storage, and ensuring a responsive and polished UI.

## Demo

- The app would allow users to upload files (e.g., text files, PDFs) or enter text, select conversion options (e.g., voice, language, speed), and generate audio files.
- Users could save their favorite text-to-speech conversions, share audio files with others, and receive notifications about new conversion options.

## Directions for Future Development

- The app could be expanded to include more advanced features, such as voice cloning, custom voices, or integration with other applications.
- The app could integrate with social media platforms to allow users to share audio files directly from the app.

## Presentation Requirements

- The elevator pitch would be a concise description of the app's purpose and value proposition.
- The concept would be explained in more detail, including the user story and motivation for development.
- The process would be described, including the technologies used, task and role assignments, challenges, and successes.
- The demo would showcase the app's features and functionality.
- Directions for future development would be outlined.
- Links to the deployed application and GitHub repository would be provided.

## Grading Requirements

- The project would meet the technical acceptance criteria, concept, deployment, repository quality, application quality, presentation, and collaboration requirements outlined in the project criteria.

This text-to-speech app idea provides a unique approach to meeting the project criteria, focusing on allowing users to upload files and enter text for conversion into speech.
